====== CHANGE LOG ======

=== 15/03/10 ===

 * Changed the month detecting function to work with up to 12 months.
 * Now all the required libs are loaded when logging in, not just before
 they are needed; this centralizes the action, and eases further dev.
 * Added the ColorPicker jQuery plugin.
 * Started work on the colour add dialog in the Controls.
